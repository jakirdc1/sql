			<h4>96.	Stub</h4>
			<p>Stub is the portion of a decision table that lists all the conditions to be examined and the various possible actions to be taken. </p>
			<h4>97.	Action Entry</h4>
			<p>Action entry is an indication of an action to be taken under a rule in a decision table.</p>
			<h4>98.	Action Stub</h4>
			<p>Action stub is the list of actions in a decision table.</p>
			<h4>99.	Condition Entry</h4>
			<p>Condition entry is an indication of the status of a relevant condition for a rule in a decision table. </p>
			<h4>100.	Condition Stub</h4>
			<p>Condition stub is the list of conditions in a decision table.</p>
			<h4>101.	Contradiction</h4>
			<p>Contradiction is a situation in a decision table in which the same combinations of conditions lead to different actions. </p>
			<h4>102.	Decision Table</h4>
			<p>Decision table is a tool for planning and documenting processing that involves complex combinations of conditions. There are four components of decision table. They are: Action Entry, Action Stub, Condition Entry and Condition Stub.</p>
			<h4>103.	Program Switch</h4>
			<p>Program switch is a field in memory, having the value of true or false that is used to record a condition. </p>
			<h4>104.	Redundancy</h4>
			<p>Redundancy is a situation in which more than one rule of a decision table may be applied for a given combination of conditions. Redundancy exists when there are more rules than are necessary.
			<ol>
            	<li>Look for two rules that have the same actions</li>
                <li>Then if all condition entries but one are exactly the same, there is redundancy between the two rules</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
			<h4>105.	Rule</h4>
			<p>Rule is a part of decision table that indicates what actions are to be taken under a given combination of 				conditions. </p>
