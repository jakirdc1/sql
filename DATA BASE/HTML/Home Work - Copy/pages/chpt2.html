			<h4>47.	Module</h4>
			<p>A piece of a program that performs a single, limited function.</p>
			<h4>48.	Modular Programming</h4>
			<p>Modular programming is an early stage in the development of structured programming. A program is broken down into pieces, or modules which can be coded and tested separately. </p>
			<ol>
				<li>An early stage of structured programming</li>
				<li>A program is broken down into pieces or modules</li>
				<li>Coding, testing and debugging separately</li>
				<li>Limited task to perform</li>
				<li>A module may temporarily transfer control to another module</li>
				<li>Modules are independent</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>49.	Dummy Module</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>50.	Subroutine</h4>
			<p>A set of instructions for performing a particular task that can be called when needed.</p>
			<h4>51.	Internal Subroutine</h4>
			<p>Internal subroutine is a set of instructions for performing a particular task that is written as a part of the using program. The use of an internal subroutine is represented in a program flowchart by a horizontally striped process outline.</p>
			<h4>52.	External Subroutine</h4>
			<p>External subroutine is a set of instructions for performing a particular task that can be used by any program because the instructions reside in a library that is external to the using program. The use of an external subroutine is represented in a program flowchart by the predefined process outline. </p>
			<h4>53.	Top Down Programming / Top Down Approach</h4>
			<p>Top-down programming is a technique for planning a structured program in which the entire program is first broken down into three modules of processing:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The processing that takes place before any data is processed, </li>
				<li>The processing of the data and </li>
				<li>The processing that takes place after all data records have been read. </li>
			</ol>
			<h4>54.	Gotoless Programming</h4>
			<p>Programming without the use of branch instructions is called GOTOless programming.  GOTOless programming is writing a program without using goto instructions, an important rule in structured programming. A goto instruction points to a different part of the program without a guarantee of returning. Instead of using goto's, structures called "subroutines" or "functions" are used, which automatically return to the next instruction after the calling instruction when completed.</p>
			<h4>55.	Hierarchy Chart</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>56.	Structure Chart</h4>
			<p>Structure chart is a planning tool to use in the top-down structured program that shows the modules that comprise the program and also shows the modules called by each module.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>This tool is sometimes referred to as a hierarchy or chart or visual table of contents.</li>
				<li>There are no standard for structure charts.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>57.	Structured Programming</h4>
			<p>A collection of techniques for the planning and writing of programs that increases programmer productivity is called Programming Structures. As for example: top-down programming and the use of sequence, loop and selection structures. </p>			
			<h4>58.	Sequence Structure</h4>
			<p>Sequence structure is one of the three fundamental programming structures; provides for the execution of instructions in the order in which they are encountered. </p>
			<h4>59.	Loop Structure / Iteration Structure</h4>
			<p>Loop structure is one of the three fundamental programming structures; provides for the repetition of certain instructions as long as a condition is true. </p>
			<h4>60.	Selection Structure</h4>
			<p>Selection structure is one of the three fundamental programming structures; provides the ability to choose between two alternative courses of action on the basis of whether a condition is true or false. </p>
			<h4>61.	Call</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>62.	Condition</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>63.	DO WHILE</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>64.	IF-THEN-ELSE</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>65.	I / O</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>66.	Nested</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>67.	null ELSE</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>68.	Priming read</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>69.	Pseudocode</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>70.	Return</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>71.	VTOC (Visual Table Of Contents)</h4>
			<p></p>
			<h4>72.	User</h4>
			<p></p>
